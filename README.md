# Loan Approval Prediction

This project predicts loan approval status using machine learning. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training/evaluation.

---

## Project Structure

```
.
├── train_00000.csv           # Training dataset
├── test_0000.csv             # Test dataset
└── HouseLoan-1.ipynb         # Main Jupyter Notebook
```

---

## Dataset Description

- **Loan_ID**: Unique identifier
- **Gender**: Male/Female
- **Married**: Yes/No
- **Dependents**: Number of dependents (0, 1, 2, 3+)
- **Education**: Graduate/Not Graduate
- **Self_Employed**: Yes/No
- **ApplicantIncome**: Applicant’s income
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Coapplicant’s income
- **LoanAmount**: Loan amount in thousands
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Term of loan in months
- **Credit_History**: 1 (meets guidelines), 0 (does not)
- **Property_Area**: Urban/Rural/Semiurban
- **Loan_Status**: Target variable (Y/N)

---

## How to Run

1. **Install Requirements**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook**

   - Open `HouseLoan-1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

3. **Execute Cells**

   - Run all cells in order for data loading, cleaning, analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Data Loading

- Reads training and test CSV files.

### 2. Data Cleaning

- Handles missing values using forward fill and mean imputation.
- Encodes categorical variables.

### 3. Feature Engineering

- Applies one-hot encoding or label encoding as needed.

### 4. Model Training

- Splits data into training and validation sets.
- Trains models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN.
- Evaluates models using accuracy and classification report.

### 5. Prediction

- (Optional) Use the best model to predict on `test_0000.csv`.

## Code Review & Suggestions

- **Data Loading:** Make sure file paths are correct for your environment.
- **Missing Values:** Forward fill and mean imputation are used; consider if these are appropriate for your data.
- **Encoding:** Use either label encoding or one-hot encoding per feature, not both.
- **Modeling:** StandardScaler is used for normalization, which is good practice.
- **Consistency:** Use consistent variable names (`df_train`, `df_test`) throughout.
- **Test Predictions:** Add code to preprocess and predict on the test set for deployment.

## Example: Model Training Code Snippet

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

# Example preprocessing and modeling
X = df_train.drop(['Loan_ID', 'Loan_Status'], axis=1)
y = df_train['Loan_Status'].map({'Y': 1, 'N': 0})

X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_val_scaled = scaler.transform(X_val)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_val_scaled)

print(classification_report(y_val, y_pred))
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred))
```

---

## Recommendations

- Clean up exploratory code for production.
- Add more markdown explanations and comments.
- Ensure you preprocess the test set before prediction.

---

## Summary

The project is well-structured and implements a typical machine learning pipeline for tabular data. Address minor issues for clarity and robustness. For any questions, refer to the notebook’s comments or reach out for help!
